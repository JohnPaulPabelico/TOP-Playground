    <!--LASAGNA INGREDIENTS-->
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian
        sausage and lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Sugar: </strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Spices and seasonings: </strong> This lasagna recipe is
        flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian
        seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Lasagna noodles: </strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this lasagna extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Egg: </strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
        out of the lasagna when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h3>
    <p>
      The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before
      you cut into it.

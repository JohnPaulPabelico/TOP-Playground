    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>4 ⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1:</strong> Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175
        degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon
        pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups
        flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate
        bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Moisten chicken pieces with a little water,
        then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer
        batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5:</strong> Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil
        in batches. Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165
        degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to
        drain.
